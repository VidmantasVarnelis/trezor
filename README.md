**NOTICE**
This application is one of several within my monorepo. Please note that this codebase is not executable due to missing monorepo package dependencies and a database configuration. Although this project is unrelated to React or React Native, it represents a personal hobby project that I have been developing.

More about project:
This is a quite simple application integrated currently with Telegram API, designed to display information about boosted tokens. It leverages the Dexscreener API(https://docs.dexscreener.com/api/reference) to fetch the latest details on boosted tokens on the Raydium DEX. Additionally, the application uses a Prisma database to manage subscriptions, determining who can receive these notifications.
